# Documentation Rule: Work Smarter, Not Harder

## Before Making Changes

1. **Read `docs/PROJECT_DOCS.md`** to understand project structure, conventions, and patterns.
2. **Check existing patterns** before adding new ones—avoid rebuilding what already exists.

## When Making Changes

1. **Update `docs/PROJECT_DOCS.md`** whenever you:
   - Add or change a convention
   - Add new components, pages, or assets
   - Establish a new pattern (e.g., hero + card sync)
2. **Keep docs accurate**—outdated docs are worse than no docs.

## Key Principle

Document so that future changes can be made by **referencing the docs** instead of reverse-engineering or rebuilding. One source of truth.
